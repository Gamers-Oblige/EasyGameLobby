# Easy Game Lobby

## Overview

Easy Game Lobby is your solution for streamlining the development of multiplayer game lobbies within Unity. Designed to wrap around Unity's lobby and relay systems, Easy Game Lobby offers an intuitive interface with a higher level of abstraction, making lobby development a breeze. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Easy Game Lobby provides the tools you need to jump straight into game development.

Be aware that Easy Game Lobby only handles the lobby system, from connecting players together within Relay and starting your game scene. It does not handle the game's networking or gameplay logic.
